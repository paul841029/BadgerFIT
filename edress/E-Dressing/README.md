# E-Dressing

E-Dressing is an augmented reality dressing room where the image of the user is captured by the camera and given as an input. By using the face and body detection techniques, the video is scanned for the presence of human faces and product images are then masked. Now the masked image is superimposed and the user can see the images of the dresses and face accessories on self.
