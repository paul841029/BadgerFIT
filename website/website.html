<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>
        Nowadays, people are purchasing most of their items online and are spending more on it especially in fashion items
        since browsing different styles and categories of clothes is easy with just a few mouse clicks. Despite the
        convenience that online shopping provides, customers tend to concern about how a particular fashion item image
        on the website would fit with themselves. Therefore, there is an urgent demand to provide a quick and simple
        solution for virtual try-on. Instead of using 3D information such as depth of the image, we believe simply rely
        on the regular 2D photo is the most convenient way to satisfy this need. With the recent progress in virtual
        try-on technologies, people can have a better online shopping experience by accurately envisioning themselves
        wearing the clothes from online categories. Furthermore, virtual try-on technologies not only have demand in
        online shopping but also in physical shopping. In other words, with the try-on technologies developed on mobile
        application, customers can save their time of going into the fitting room.
</p>
<p>
        In this project, we investigate the evolution of the virtual try-on systems using images of clothes on the Internet
        and photos of models from e-commerce websites. There are two stages of the development for our project.
        First, to prepare input image for the network in the second stage, 
        we investigated computer vision techniques that we have learned in
        class such as image stitching, background removal, and object detection. In the
        second stage, we developed framework that implements recent deep learning techniques in virtual try-on
        applications. For example, using generative adversarial nets (GAN) <span class="citation"
                data-cites="goodfellow2014generative"> (Goodfellow et al. 2014)</span> as a generative machine learning
        model to synthesize virtual image of the model wearing unseen clothes. As a deliverable, we developed a web service <span style="color: white; background-color: red;"> add link to the web app</span> based upon 
        current state-of-the-art virtual-try-on architecture, CP-VTON (Wang et al. 2018), which is published in ECCV 2018.

<h3 id="viton"><i>VITON</i></h3>
VITON <span class="citation" data-cites="han2018viton"> (Han et al. 2018)</span> is a virtual
try-on network with an encoder-decoder generator as its core component. Instead of accessing 3D information such
as in previous techniques <span class="citation" data-cites="guan2012drape"> (Guan et al. 2012)</span>, VITON
only leveraged 2D information in its virtual try-on network. Therefore, VITON reduces the resource footprint and
enables a broader set of applications. State-of-art methods such as ClothFlow <span class="citation"
        data-cites="han2019clothflow"> (Han et al. 2019)</span> outperforms VITON by extending the networks in
VITON. In particular, ClothFlow divides the try-on framework into three stages. (1) target segmentation map
generation. (2) refinement of geometric information in a cascaded warping manner. (3) synthesis of the final
result. These extra stages are shown to improve the synthesis of photo-realistic images.

<h3 id="drape"><i>DRAPE</i></h3>

<p>
        Seminal work on virtual fitting with traditional computer vision techniques is DRAPE <span class="citation"
                data-cites="guan2012drape">(Guan et al. 2012)</span>. DRAPE model is trained with meshes of pose of
        person and shapes of clothes. They utilized <em>shape deformation gradients</em>, a linear transformation
        function that aims to align triangles from source and target mesh, to represent deformation between meshes.
        DRAPE applied the process of deformation due to body shape, rigid part rotation, and body pose. Recent advances
        in machine learning, in particular, deep neural networks forwards the performance of virtual try-on systems
        significantly. In our study, we did not investigate DARPE since DARPE requires 3D meshes whereas we
        decided to focus on techniques for 2D image in this project. Instead, we found a project named E-dressing
        (described below) in the public domain which relies on traditional machine learning techniques to implement
        virtual fitting room.
</p>

<h3 id="e-dressing"><i>E-Dressing</i></h3>
<p>
        We investigated E-Dressing<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> which
        is a system that uses traditional machine learning methods, in particular, an ensemble of regression trees <span
                class="citation" data-cites="kazemi2014one"> (Kazemi and Sullivan 2014)</span>, to perform the tasks of
        virtual try-on. However, after experimenting with the system and running author-provided demos, we would argue
        that E-Dressing is limited to try-on of items on faces. For example, glasses and earrings. Although this does
        not align with our original plan of the project, we see the possibility of integrating this feature into our
        final system to have a full-body try-on feature since CP-VTON (as described below) only support try-on of
        shirts.

<h3 id="data-preparation-and-pre-processing">Data Preparation and Pre-Processing</h3>

<h4 id="scraper-for-clothes-images">Scraper for Clothes Images</h4>
<p>
                In order to gather data for training and evaluation purposes, we have implemented a scraper to scrape clothes images
                from E-Commerce websites.
        </p>
<p>
        We used Scrapy with Python and implemented a website crawler and scraper. In particular, we targeted the E-Commerce
        website <a href="https://uniqlo.com">https://uniqlo.com</a> and scraped for their women’s T-shirt images. We report two technical challenges we faced while developing the web scraper.
</p>

        <p>
                First, in the image dataset we scraped, it does not only contain cloth-only images. Instead, there are images that contained model or images that focus on different details of clothes. Since our framework requires images that only contain clothes as input, we currently manually select desired image from the image dataset returned from the web scraper. As a future plan, we can incorporate exiting image classification techniques to replace this manual effort. 
        </p>
        <p>
                Second, most clothes images comes with background, and for our model we need the background-removed image with a
                binary mask. Therefore, we investigated and implementing several background-removal techniques as described below.
        </p>
<h4 id="image-background-removal">Image Background Removal</h4>
<p>
        In order to remove background from images, we investigated both traditional-CV methods and machine-learning methods.
        We found out that although machine-learning methods generally performs better results, it only works well on the
        same subject when it was trained. For example, a library we tested<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
                id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> which uses 100 layers of Tiramisu DensNet trained on
        images with person works well on removing background from images that contain one person, but performs terribly
        on even really easy t-shirt-only images (Figure <a href="#fig:bgrm-ml" data-reference-type="ref"
                data-reference="fig:bgrm-ml">2</a>).
        </p>
<p>
        <img src="rmbg/ml-person.png" title="fig:" id="fig:bgrm-ml" style="width:100.0%"
                alt="Background Removal using Machine Learning methods" /> <img src="rmbg/ml-tshirt.png" title="fig:"
                id="fig:bgrm-ml" style="width:100.0%" alt="Background Removal using Machine Learning methods" /></p>
<p>Next we tried using traditional-CV methods for image background removal. Specifically, we tried using Canny edge
        detection algorithm and Otsu’s thresholding algorithm, using OpenCV. The main problem is that although this
        works reasonably well on some easy cases (clean monotonic background with contrasted-colored t-shirt), it is
        hard to tune the thresholds for every kind of t-shirt to have clean results.
</p>
<p>
        We have created a simple web page (online demo<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
                role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>) using OpenCV.js, in order to visualize the effect of tuning
        Brightness/Contrast together with comparing two algorithms mentioned above, and to visually check each steps
        output to further improve the algorithm pipelines. On this web page, we can test out different clothes and
        change their brightness/contrast and toggle pipeline such as morphing steps to see how they affect the generated
        contours and masks. The screenshot result for the same easy t-shirt-only is shown in Figure <a
                href="#fig:bgrm-cv" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:bgrm-cv">3</a>.

                traditional CV methods</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 id="cp-vton">CP-VTON</h3>
<p>
        We reimplemented the network described in <i>Toward characteristic-preserving image-based virtual try-on network</i> (Wang et al.
        2018) using the
        same dataset and model settings.
</p>
<h4 id="dataset-preprocessing">Dataset &amp; Preprocessing</h4>
<p>
        For the dataset, we use the same data provided by original VITON &amp; CP-VTON,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref"
                id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> which use OpenPose<span class="citation"
                data-cites="cao2018openpose">(Cao et al. 2018)</span> for JSON format pose information, and
        LIP_JPPNet<span class="citation" data-cites="liang2018look"> (Liang et al. 2018)</span> for model image
        segmentation.
</p>
<h4 id="methodology">Methodology</h4>
<p>
        In CP-VTON, the author use a two-stage solution to deal with the virtual try-on problem. First, it learns a transformation
        for transforming the clothes into fitting the body shape of the target person via a new Geometric Matching
        Module (GMM). Second, to mitigate edge artifacts of warped clothes and make the results more realistic, CP-VTON
        applies a Try-On Module (TOM) that learns a combination mask to integrate the warped clothes and the rendered
        image to ensure smoothness.<br />

<h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2>
<p>
        We use provided dataset to evaluate the model result in Figure <a href="#fig:provided" data-reference-type="ref"
                data-reference="fig:provided">6</a>. Furthermore, we use our own data to see
        the model effect in Figure <a href="#fig:our" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:our">8</a>. In particular, the cloth images here are the ones we obtained from our web scraper.
</p>
<p>
        We can see better try-on results in the provided dataset compared to using our dataset. We guess it is due to difference between the distribution of the train data and test data. Since we crawl our dataset on the Internet and doing
        minor preprocess (crop and resize), many aspects can affect the original model inference such as image quality,
        background removal, cloth texture varies in brands and so on. Moreover, we notice that there’s a limitation
        using CP-VTON. That is, it will transfer Human Model’s pants into different texture or even color.

<h2>Demonstration Walk-through</h2>
<h3 style="background-color: red; color: white;">ADD ME!</h3>
<p>
To wrap up our project, we dockerize each module (openpose, LIP_JPPNet, cp-vton, Background-Removal) and deploy a demo website 
on Google Cloud Platform using both Cloud Function and Cloud Run. In the website, users can upload whatever cloth and model 
image they want, then our backend will parse those input and feed into our BadgerFIT pipeline. Finally, the virtual try-on 
result will show as well as the intermediate result such as image segmentation, image keypoints on the website.
